# Robert di Scipio - Portfolio
------------------------------

## Summary
_________

> This is my portfolio page that I made from the bottom up. It's designed to showcase my skills and have people contact me if they want to use my services.
>
> The motivation behind my idea was based off my personality. I like being put together, cool, confident, and collected, but once you get to know me you realize that I'm a little bit of a dork.

##Approach
___________

> I like to start out by mapping out my wireframes on paper before I even start typing away at a computer. I knew that I Was going to have a lot of nested elements inside of each other to get the page exactly how I wanted it to be. It was a lot of trial and error. I broke it down, by trying to finish it in parts, eg. finish the HTML first, then move on to the CSS and break that down by section too. It helps to break things down in pieces rather than looking at the whole thing and realizing it's this daunting task. I was able to finish relatively on time with only a few hangups throughout.

## Software
__________

> For this project I built it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap
>
> The project has an API that grabs data from a Google Sheet an auto populates a slide in the Projects section of my Page

## Biggest Wins & Challenges
__________________________

> My biggest win was getting the contact form to look like it's laying on top of the piece of the page above it. I had a lot of fun playing around with that, using position absolute, z-index, and a few other things.

> Another win for me was actually the amount of CSS that I put into the code. All in all it was over 500 lines of code. Looking back at it, I probably could have done a few things in globally, but I can always revisit this at a later time. But doing that much really let me know how far I've come since I started my learning at GA.

> One of my biggest challenges was the API call. I worked on it for about 3 days. I finished the html and CSS for the portfolio ahead of schedule, and didn't think it would take as long as it did for the JS to work. I had two different functions [function one](https://i.imgur.com/RYSPVdJ.png) and had help with the second one [function two](https://i.imgur.com/pw8u5JG.png). Shoutout to my friends Darrin Im, Aaron Kim, and Soleil Solomon for helping me as much as they could to make the API work.

> Lastly, one of the biggest unsolved problems I had was... also with the API. After I finally got the info to get pulled from the Google sheet I had the information on, the photos weren't appearing on the page. I got it to show the the info was being put onto the page, but for whatever reason, something was stopping the photos from appearing on the page. Aaron Kim helped me figure that one out.

## Wireframes
____________

> I like to draw out my wireframes so my ideas are out onto paper before I start coding. The end product wasn't too far off from my original ideas either.

## MVP
_____

> I was able to have a fully working mobile, tablet, and desktop version of my portfolio, which is what I wanted to have from the beginning. I ended up with clean cut, nice layout, to showcase my skills.
>
> I do want to revisit my portfolio and maybe try rebuilding it in a different way eventually.
>
> My MVP includes a working Nav, each section of my portfolio laid out, and a contact form for people to message me.'


## External Resources
____________________

> I used W3Schools and StackOverflow for some of my troubleshooting problems.
>
> I also used code from Joe Keohan to build the cards/ API call


## Post Build
____________

> Things I wanted to include:
>
> I wanted to include some animations to the text for users as they scroll down and when they hovered over the images. I think that would have been pretty fun.
>
> I also wanted to add a sticky button that when clicked, would send the person back to the top of page. It's a simple thing, but I didn't think of it until 10:30 the night before it was due.
