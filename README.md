# Robert di Scipio - Portfolio
------------------------------

##Summary

> This is my portfolio page as a software engineer that I made for myself. It's designed to showcase my skills and have people contact me if they want to use my services.
>
> The motivation behind my idea was based off my personality. I like being put together, cool, confident, and collected, but once you get to know me you realize that I'm a little bit of a dork.

##Software

> For this project I built it using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap
>
> The project has an API that grabs data from a Google Sheet an auto populates a slide in the Projects section of my Page

##Wireframes

> Sketches - I like to draw out my sketches to get my ideas out onto paper before I start coding. The end product wasn't too far off from my original ideas either.

##MVP

> I was able to have a fully working mobile, tablet, and desktop version of my portfolio, which is what I wanted to have from the beginning. I ended up with clean cut, nice layout, to showcase my skills.
>
> I do want to revisit my portfolio and maybe try rebuilding it in a different way eventually.
>
> My MVP includes a working Nav, each section of my portfolio laid out, and a contact form for people to message me.

##Post Build

> Things I wanted to include:
>
> I wanted to include some animations to the text for users as they scroll down and when they hovered over the images. I think that would have been pretty fun.
